# Hello World

Greetings All,

this is the github repository for my new project: Immutable Homelab

## What is an Immutable homelab?

First, let's talk about what immutable means, what is a homelab and why this project exists.

Immutable is anything that cannot be changed or modified. In IT it's used to describe a resource that is not changed after it's creation.

Think of a homelab as a sandbox, at home, for IT professionals to experiment, learn and practice new ideas for their personal and career growth. My sandbox consists of computers i've collected over the years, some of which is used to provide services for my family (e.g. Unifi Access Point w/ Cloud Key).
